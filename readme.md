# 🛠️ Practical Data Collection & Preprocessing (Python & SQL)

Most real-world data isn’t clean—it’s messy, incomplete, and spread across sources like websites, APIs, and databases. This repository provides a structured approach to collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for professional analysis using Python and SQL.

The repository is divided into **Concepts** (theoretical knowledge) and **Algorithms** (practical implementation).

## 🚀 Practical Applications
This repository uses real-world scenarios to demonstrate these skills:

* **Website Testimonials**: Filtering by language, removing PII (Personally Identifying Information), and selecting messages with positive sentiment.
* **Hashtag Ranking**: Stripping media from social posts to extract, count, and rank unique hashtags for marketing trends.
